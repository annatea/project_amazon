Scraping data from amazon website and analyzing it
For this project I scraped data from the Amazon website on four brands of laptops: Apple, Dell, Lenovo and HP, 
and with the help of Python analyzed the scraped dataset, then visualised the dataset with the help of R and made my assumptions. Hope this will be helpful!
